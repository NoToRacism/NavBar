# Responsive React Navbar Component

This project features a responsive navigation bar component built with React. On smaller screens, it displays a toggle button ("hamburger" icon) that smoothly animates the opening and closing of the navigation links container. The height of the container is dynamically calculated using `useRef` and `getBoundingClientRect` to ensure a perfect transition regardless of the number of links. On larger screens, the toggle is hidden, and links and social media icons are displayed horizontally. The navigation links and social icons are managed via a separate data file (`data.jsx`) for easy customization.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adapts layout for different screen sizes (mobile toggle vs. desktop horizontal display).
* **Smooth Toggle Animation:** Uses CSS transitions and dynamic height calculation for a fluid expand/collapse effect on mobile.
* **Dynamic Height Calculation:** Employs `useRef` and `getBoundingClientRect()` to precisely measure link container height, ensuring the animation works correctly even if link content changes.
* **Data-Driven Content:** Navigation links and social media icons are populated from a central `data.jsx` file.
* **Icon Integration:** Uses `react-icons` for easily incorporating icons (like the hamburger menu toggle).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React.js (Hooks: `useState`, `useRef`)
* **Icons:** `react-icons`
* **Styling:** CSS (including CSS Variables, Transitions, and Media Queries)
* **JavaScript:** `Element.getBoundingClientRect()` for dynamic measurements

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To use or test this component locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    This will typically open a demo page in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìñ Usage / Integration

1.  **Import the Component:** Import the `Navbar` component into your desired React application file:
    ```javascript
    import Navbar from './Navbar'; // Adjust path as needed
    ```
2.  **Render the Component:** Place the `<Navbar />` component in your application's layout, typically near the top.
    ```javascript
    function App() {
      return (
        <>
          <Navbar />
          {/* Other components */}
        </>
      );
    }
    ```
3.  **Customize Data:** Modify the `links` and `social` arrays in `src/data.jsx` to change the navigation items and social media links/icons.
4.  **Styling:** Ensure the associated CSS file (e.g., `index.css` or `Navbar.css`) is imported or included in your project's styling setup. Customize CSS variables and classes as needed.

    * `logo.svg`: The logo image file used in the navbar.
    * CSS Files (`index.css`, `App.css`, etc.): (Assumed) Contain the necessary styles, including variables, base styles, component styles, and media queries.
* `public/`: Contains static assets.
* `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
